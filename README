Life-changing utility for saving files under new names in Vim with automated clean up of the old file's buffer and hard disk version.

Usage:
Call the function by one of the methods below. Insert the desired new /optional/newpath/filename and press <Enter>.
The new file will be saved, a buffer for it will be opened, the old file's buffer closed and the old file deleted (if was written to disk).

Method 1 (preferred):
    <leader>R
brings up the function call with the current file's full path.

Method 2:
     :Repfile
will operate from Vim's CWD, not with the buffers directory.

Mapping:
The default mapping is:
    <leader>R

If you want to change that, put
    let g:RepCall="yourmapping"
in your vimrc.

Added BufKill support to be able to delete/unload/wipeout a buffer without loosing it's window.
Get BufKill here: vimscript#1147 (not neccessary, but really recommended)
